# QwiicLCD Rust Library - Bug Fixes and Code Improvements

## Summary of Changes

### Bugs Fixed
1. **ScreenConfig::new() bug** - The constructor was ignoring its parameters and always creating a 4x20 config
2. **Invalid range checks in move_cursor()** - Comparing usize values with < 0 which is impossible
3. **Missing error handling** - The clear() method wasn't propagating errors from write_setting_cmd
4. **Unnecessary parentheses** - Removed extra parentheses in smbus_write_byte_data calls

### Code Quality Improvements
1. **Implemented Default trait properly** - Replaced custom default() methods with proper Default trait implementation
2. **Simplified code** - Removed unnecessary mutable variable in change_backlight, simplified bitwise operations
3. **Removed unused code** - Eliminated unused variable in test_init
4. **Added Rust 2021 edition** - Updated Cargo.toml to use Rust 2021 edition
5. **Code formatting** - Applied cargo fmt for consistent formatting

### Documentation Enhancements
1. **Added comprehensive doc comments** for all public:
   - Enums (Command, EntryMode, DisplayStatus, etc.)
   - Structs (ScreenConfig, DisplayState, Screen)
   - Methods (new, init, clear, home, move_cursor, etc.)
   - Functions (map)

### Verification
- All changes compile without warnings
- Code passes cargo clippy checks
- Code is properly formatted with cargo fmt
- Release build completes successfully

## Impact
These changes improve code reliability, maintainability, and usability of the library while fixing critical bugs that could cause unexpected behavior.

## Current Work Session

### Documentation Maintenance
- Reviewed and updated project documentation structure
- Maintained project_description.md, overview.md, and todo.md files
- Documented testing strategy and requirements

### Testing Strategy
- Identified need for comprehensive unit tests for all public methods
- Planning to create mock I2C device for hardware-independent testing
- Will add property-based testing for range validations
- Create separate unit tests module for better organization

### Code Analysis Findings
- Library has one integration test but lacks unit tests
- Core functionality includes:
  - Screen initialization and configuration
  - RGB backlight control
  - Cursor positioning and visibility
  - Text display operations
  - Display state management
- Utility function `map()` for value range conversion needs testing
- ScreenConfig and DisplayState structs properly implement Default trait

### Testing Implementation Completed
- Added 17 comprehensive unit tests covering:
  - `map()` function with edge cases and bounds checking
  - ScreenConfig creation and default values
  - DisplayState creation and default values
  - All enum value constants verification
- Fixed `map()` function to handle:
  - Division by zero edge case
  - Integer overflow/underflow
  - Out-of-bounds input values
- All tests now pass successfully (17 passed, 1 ignored due to hardware requirement)
- Code builds without warnings and passes clippy checks

### Identified Unused Enums
The following enums are defined but not currently used in the public API:
- EntryShift - for LCD entry mode shifting
- MoveType - for cursor/display movement types
- MoveDirection - for movement directions
- Backlight - for backlight on/off states
- WriteMode - for LCD write modes
- BitMode - for 4-bit/8-bit communication modes

These may be intended for future LCD command implementations or lower-level control.
